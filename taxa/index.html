title: Taxa

<p>This is the taxa page. It lists all of the taxa in your site. The theme does not provide a taxa page since not every site may want such a page, but a taxa <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/">layout</a> is provided so sites that want a taxa page don't necessarily have to implement one from scratch.</p>

<p>The taxa listed on this page are <a href="https://github.com/legumeinfo/jekyll-theme-legumeinfo?tab=readme-ov-file#taxa">loaded from a YAML file</a>. The theme also generates a page for each species using the Jekyll <a href="https://github.com/avillafiorita/jekyll-datapage_gen">datapage-generator</a> plugin.</p>
