<p>This is the tools page. It lists all of the tools in your site. The {{ site.theme_link }} does not provide a tools page since not every site may want such a page, but a tools <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/" target="_blank">layout</a> is provided so sites that want a tools page don't necessarily have to implement one from scratch.</p>

<p>The tools listed on this page are <a href="https://github.com/legumeinfo/jekyll-theme-legumeinfo?tab=readme-ov-file#tools" target="_blank">loaded from a YAML file</a>. The tools menu on the left is not actually specific to this page. The {{ site.theme_name }} supports adding this menu to any page via <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/" target="_blank">YAML front matter</a>.</p>
