title: So, What is Jekyll?
author: Alan Cleary
summary: And why should you care?

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a tool for transforming your plain text into static websites and blogs.
It is simple, static, and blog-aware.
Jekyll uses the [Liquid](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-basics) templating language and has builtin [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [Textile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)) support.

It also ties in nicely to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

You should care because it's what the Legume Information System and other related sites are now built on.
In fact, [there's a theme](https://github.com/legumeinfo/jekyll-theme-legumeinfo), and this is [a starter site](https://github.com/legumeinfo/jekyll-starter-legumeinfo) that demonstrates how to use the theme!
