<p>This is the blog page. It lists all of the blog posts on your site. The {{ site.theme_link }} does not provide a blog page since not every site may want such a page, but a blog <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/">layout</a> is provided so sites that want a blog page don't necessarily have to implement one from scratch.</p>

<p>The posts listed on this page are <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/">Jekyll posts</a>. When the site is built a separate page is generated for each post. A <a href="https://github.com/legumeinfo/jekyll-theme-legumeinfo?tab=readme-ov-file#blog-events-and-news">blog post layout</a> is provided by the {{ site.theme_name }} for these generated pages.</p>

<p>The blog posts card on the right side of this page is not actually specific to this page. The {{ site.theme_name }} supports adding this card to any page via <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/">YAML front matter</a>.</p>
