summary: A celebration of the Legume Information System's past, present, and future.

On January 1, 2005, the twelfth Database Issue of <i>Nucleic Acids Research</i> was published.
In this issue was a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gki128) introducing the Legume Information System to the world.
Thus began 20 years of <s>bean puns</s> legume informatics, with the Legume Information System establishing itself as a global cornerstone of legume research.

In celebration of the Legume Information System's storied past, vibrant present, and bright future, the National Center for Genome Resources will be hosting a potluck dinner on the 20th anniversary of the seminal Nucleic Acids Research paper.
The who's who of legume researchers will be in attendance and a special award will be given for the most groanworthy bean pun.
Legume dishes only.
