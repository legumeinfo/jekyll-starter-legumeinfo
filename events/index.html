<p>This is the events page. It lists all previous and upcoming events on your site. The {{ site.theme_link }} does not provide an events page since not every site may want such a page, but an events <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/" target="_blank">layout</a> is provided so sites that want an events page don't necessarily have to implement one from scratch.</p>

<p>The events listed on this page are <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/" target="_blank">Jekyll posts</a>. When the site is built a separate page is generated for each post. An <a href="https://github.com/legumeinfo/jekyll-theme-legumeinfo?tab=readme-ov-file#blog-events-and-news" target="_blank">event layout</a> is provided by the {{ site.theme_name }} for these generated pages.</p>

<p>The events card on the right side of this page is not actually specific to this page. The {{ site.theme_name }} supports adding this card to any page via <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/" target="_blank">YAML front matter</a>.</p>

<p>Note that future post <a href="https://github.com/legumeinfo/jekyll-theme-legumeinfo?tab=readme-ov-file#installation" target="_blank">must be enabled</a> to support listing upcoming events.</p>
