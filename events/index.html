<p>This is the events page. It lists all previous and upcoming events on your site. The theme does not provide an events page since not every site may want such a page, but an events <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/">layout</a> is provided so sites that want an events page don't necessarily have to implement one from scratch.</p>

<p>The events listed on this page are <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/">Jekyll posts</a>. When the site is built a separate page is generated for each post. A <a href="https://github.com/legumeinfo/jekyll-theme-legumeinfo?tab=readme-ov-file#blog-events-and-news">event layout</a> is provided by the theme for these generated pages.</p>

<p>The events card on the right side of this page is not actually specific to this page. The theme supports adding this card to any page via <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/">YAML front matter</a>.</p>

<p>Note that future post <a href="https://github.com/legumeinfo/jekyll-theme-legumeinfo?tab=readme-ov-file#installation">must be enabled</a> to support listing upcoming events.</p>
